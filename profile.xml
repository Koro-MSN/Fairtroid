It aims to make all the Areas, UI elements, Map, Suits, Enemies, and Projectiles to be more stylized and more friendly to users who play in dimly lit areas. It is also meant to be a base &amp;quot;engine&amp;quot; (not really) for whoever wishes to use it for their own mods, allowing more visual customization, as well including new tracks.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is the only release since 2D and 3D palettes are in the same mod.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Special thanks to Mystical, TheyCallMeXander, Princess Lucina, ssanoo, rm_steele, Kragondor573, ANXVariable, Ehseezed, Bastion B-56, DruidVorse, Alex87, ShirtyScarab554, Lojemiru, LightSnake and Team-Z for all the support, help and testing. It truly means a lot!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Soundtrack is credited in the GitHub and in-game credits." />
